# SQL-Power-Bi-Sales-Insights-Project

**Situation**: A computer hardware company's sales director is facing an issue with his company's sales insights. He is unable to track and get a clear picture of the situation  due to regional managers hiding the problems, inaccuracy in the data and being burried in excel files. 

**Task**: To provide an automated dashboard that helps in making data-driven decisions to optimise sales.

**Action**: Analyzing data using SQL and Power BI to track revenue growth, YOY trends, and region-wise sales performance.

**Result**: The dashboard provided actionable insights that would lead to potential revenue increase in the next quarter.
